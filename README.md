# AudioTTS
> A text to speech software utilizing Google's WaveNet technology. 

![](header.png)

Having struggled with ADHD, I often find myself using audio books for reading, but am often unable to find them for 
textbooks. Unsatisfied with traditional TTS software, and not wanting to pay a tramendous amount for premium software,
I decided to make my own using Google's WaveNet technology.

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
