![](header.png)

Having struggled with ADHD, I often find myself using audio books for reading, but am often unable to find them for 
textbooks. Unsatisfied with traditional TTS software, and not wanting to pay a tramendous amount for premium software,
I decided to make my own using Google's WaveNet technology.

## Getting Started
